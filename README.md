### Important Disclamer
This application is a personal project developed primarily for educational purposes. It currently uses "MyFitnessApp" as a placeholder. Should any issues arise regarding the name or any other aspects of the project, I am prepared to make necessary changes, including removing the project from public access or renaming it.

The icon used for this application was initially generated with the help of GPT-4 and edited by me using [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/). If any concerns are raised about the uses of this image, I will modify the image upon request.

Please note that the application is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. I do not assume any responsibility for its use or functionality. Users are encouraged to verify the applicability and safety of the application in their own context.
