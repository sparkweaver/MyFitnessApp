# MyFitnessApp

**MyFitnessApp** is a personal project designed to enhance my daily fitness routines by providing essential tools tailored for various activities. Starting with the basic step counter, I aim to gradually expand its features to include timers, total distance, personalized user experiences, and comprehensive functionalities for diet and work management. A fun future consideration is the addition of a virtual coach, who will offer encouragement for fitness goals.

## Features

* **Step Coutner**: Tracks your steps throughout the session.

*Additional features will be introduced in the future.*

## Installation

The **MyFitnessApp** is at the moment in development, and the installation process is currently the debugging and testing version. Developers familiar with mobile app development can install the app on personal devices in a debugger environment.

## How to Use
#### Starting a walking session:
1. Open MyfitnessApp
2. Press the **Walking** button to navigate to the walking page.
3. Tap **Start** to begin tracking your session.

*Note: There is a short warmup time before the application starts tracking steps correctly.*

### Adjust Settings:
1. To adjust the sensitivity and adaptativity, navigate to the **Settings** page.
2. Adjust the respective slider's desired level and tap **Save** to apply the changes.
3. To revert to the standard settings, tap **Reset**.

*Note: Make sure to stop the current session before making adjustments. This prevents the current settings from overriding any changes you apply*

### Note
In addition to the project, I chose to explore the use of the GitHub milestone feature to better organize and track the progress. This is my first time, so the issues may not be as organized as they could be.

## Future Updates

* **Distance Tracker**: Plans to add a feature that measures the total distance.
* **Timer**: Direct access to a timer in the application.
* **Profiles**: Should accommodate different users.
* **Diet Management**: Will include tools to help with managing your diet and tracking calorie and nutrition intake.
* **Virtual Fitness Coach**: Exploring the possibility of integrating a virtual coach that will provide support.

#### Important Disclamer
*This application is a personal project developed primarily for educational purposes, and it is fun. It currently uses "MyFitnessApp" as a placeholder. Should any issues arise regarding the name or any other aspects of the project, I am prepared to make necessary changes, including removing the project from public access or renaming it.*

*The icon used for this application was initially generated with the help of GPT-4 and edited by me using [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/). If any concerns are raised about the uses of this image, I will modify the image upon request.*

*Please note that the application is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. I do not assume any responsibility for its use or functionality. Users are encouraged to verify the applicability and safety of the application in their own context.*
