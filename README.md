Starting with the basic step counter, the app aims to gradually expand its features to include timers, total distance, personalized user experiences, and comprehensive functionalities for diet and work management.

A future consideration is the addition of a virtual coach, which will offer encouragement for your fitness goals, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features
